Wikipedia defines a kludge as "a workaround or makeshift solution that is clumsy, inelegant, inefficient, difficult to extend, and hard to maintain". This is a repository where I store my homelab automation scripts such as Cloudflare DNS record updates, Wireguard daemon restart, etc. The purpose is to develop automated solutions to homelab annoyances and for general quality of life improvements.
